# Mission Demolition

## Project Description

**Made using Unity and C# for CS 382**

Mission Demolition is a 2D Unity game where you launch projectiles out of a slingshot to try and destroy the castle and progress to the next level.

This project is based on the **MissionDemolition** tutorial from the book:

*Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development - Third Edition* by **Jeremy Gibson Bond**

In addition to the tutorial, I added several features:
- New castle designs
- Game over screen with a restart button
- Round system that progresses through four levels, which increase in difficulty 
- Rubber band attached to slingshot using a line renderer
- Slingshot sound effect after launching projectile
- Background music
